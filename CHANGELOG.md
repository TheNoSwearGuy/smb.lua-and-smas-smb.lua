- Updated the practice information to work the same as on Kaname 3.6
- All versions of Pellsson are no longer automatically detected and only Kaname is automatically detected for the NES scripts
- As a result of the previous two points, the `game` variable has been removed and replaced with the `region` variable for the NES scripts
- Made the colour of the "F" of the frame counter match the coin flash colour for the NES BizHawk scripts

- Compacted the backwards pole code for the All-Stars scripts by a ton
- Minor changes, optimizations, and fixes
