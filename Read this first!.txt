Before running any of the scripts — NES or SNES, default or sleek — you MUST open the file and set the set the 'region' variable to the region you're playing on — NTSC or PAL — in order for the framerule counter to be accurate and for the timer to use the right framerate. For the NES versions of the scripts, Kaname for SMB1 (NTSC and PAL), SMB2J, and ANNSMB is automatically detected and is prioritized over the regular games, so if you're using that, it doesn't matter what you have the 'region' variable set to. If you set the 'region' variable to a non-valid value, this will make the framerule counter and the timer default to you not playing on PAL. The 'region' variable is set to '"NTSC"' by default.

Unless you're using Kaname, the framerule counter only works with the following routes:
- Start → Small → End
- Start → Small → Mushroom → End
- Start → Small → Mushroom → Fire → End

For BizHawk, the framerule counter desyncs when you soft reset or hard reset at least 32,767 non-lag frames after loading the ROM file. For Mesen 2, Mesen, and MesenRTA, the framerule counter desyncs after 32,767 lag frames. For FCEUX, the framerule counter desyncs when you soft reset with at least one lag frame before soft resetting after loading the ROM file, as soft resetting doesn't reset the lag frame counter. Hard resetting, however, does.

The 256×224p versions of the NES sleek versions covers the text the entire time and the ones digit of the score when the remainder is displayed.
